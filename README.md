# Game Overview
  - **Players**: 2
  - **Game Board**: 10x10 grid
    - Rows: A - J
    - Columns: 1 - 10

## Game Setup
- Each player places five different ships on their own grid:
  1. Destroyer: 1 x 2 cells
  2. Submarine: 1 x 3 cells
  3. Cruiser: 1 x 3 cells
  4. Battleship: 1 x 4 cells
  5. Carrier: 1 x 5 cells

## Gameplay
- Players take turns guessing a single cell (e.g., G8) on the opponent's grid.
- A "shot" can either hit:
  1. An opponent's ship, resulting in a "hit."
  2. An empty cell, resulting in a "miss."

## Winning
- When all cells occupied by a ship are hit, the ship is "sunk."
- The first player to sink all of the opponent's ships wins the game.
